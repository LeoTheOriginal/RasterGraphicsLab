# Raster Graphics Lab

This project is a GUI-based application developed for performing various image manipulation tasks. It uses the wxWidgets library to provide a graphical user interface for operations such as grayscale conversion, blur, mirror effect, rescaling, rotating, hue rotation, and applying masks.

## Features

- Load and manipulate images with tools for grayscale, blur, mirroring, rescaling, rotating, hue rotation, and applying masks.
- Adjust brightness and contrast with sliders.
- Real-time visual feedback for all operations.
